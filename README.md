# QuickLaunch
This project is based on finding the nearest devices and pair them using the bluetooth of mobile.
During childhood i was curious about how its been done and finally after learning Android,i tried to kill my curiosity using this project.
This project took me several days to work on.
This application is fully functional.
If you want to see it working then please follow the below instructions:
1.Git clone this project and simply import it on Android Studio.
2.After this see the log messages and install the respective dependencies for it.
3.Run it on emulator or simply download the .apk file from my another repositry named as "Controlled Home and Industrial Automation".
The name of that is "app-debug(1).apk".
